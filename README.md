# About

Do Your Five is a small Java based API that tracks someone doing a stripped 5x5 starting strength workout. It aims to fulfill the goal of being written in a concise and readable manner as well as giving me a chance to become more familiar with Java 8, Spark, and Lombok.

## Installation and Getting Started

* Install `maven`
* `mvn clean compile assembly:single`
* `java -jar target\doyourfive-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## Junit
* `mvn test`

## Deploying to Heroku

This is a todo.
